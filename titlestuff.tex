\begin{abstract}

  This document describes the database and software created to analyse the Red
  Dots data, in the hope that it will be useful to complete the project in the
  near future or possibly to re-use the software for other projects.
  
  Knowledge of {\py} is fairly essential, and some knowledge or understanding
  of {\mysql} is desirable.
